# CPathTracer

A Path Tracer written in C with CMake - for fun!

Disclaimer: I've never used C before except for a few small mini programs :D
There might be extremely broken or stupid things in this code.

# Compilation

I'm working with CLion/CMake and use CLang as compiler.
Currently only windows is supported and I think there's also clang-specific stuff in the code.

YMMV :)
